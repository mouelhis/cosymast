# CoSyMA: A Tool for Controller Synthesis Using Multi-scale Abstractions

CoSyMA is a tool for automatic controller synthesis for incrementally stable switched systems based on multi-scale discrete abstractions. The tool ensures significant performance gains during the controller synthesis.

## Input

A description of a switched system represented by a set of differential equations;
the sampling parameters used to define an approximation of the state-space on which discrete abstractions are computed;

## Output

A controller -- if it exists -- for the system that enforces a given safety or time-bounded reachability specification.
